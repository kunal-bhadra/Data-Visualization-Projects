# Gender Gap in College Degrees

This is the second project I worked on while learning **Matplotlib** and **Pandas**, applying the concepts here. I visualized the difference in the genders for each degree through Line Charts as subplots, to get a better understanding of the history.


## Data Visualization Steps Done:
1. Initially exploring the DataFrame
2. Bivariate Analysis with Line Charts and subplots
3. Setting the graph labels, axes and tick settings
4. Presenting the Figure of the difference between Men and Women
