# Data Visualization Projects

A compilation of all the Data Visualization projects I have worked on, to apply my concepts of **Matplotlib**, **Pandas** and **NumPy**.

## Brief Outline
### 🏫 Gender Gap in College Degrees
Visualized the difference in the Gender Gap for each degree through Line Charts as subplots, to get a better understanding of the history.


### 💲 Earnings based on College Majors
Cleaned a dataset on my own and employed new Pandas methods to present my analysis in support of my code. 



## ✏ Data Visualization Techniques Covered:
 - Initial Exploration of the Data
 - Bivariate Analysis through Line Charts in Subplots
 - Univariate Analysis through Histograms
 - Matplotlib Figure presenting the Analysis
