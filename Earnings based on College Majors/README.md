# Earnings based on College Majors

This is the first project I worked on while learning **Matplotlib**, **Pandas** and **NumPy** and applied the concepts here. After exploring the CSV file, I analysed every other column to see if there's a relation through Bar Charts and Scatter Plots.


## Data Visualization Steps Done:
1. Initially exploring the DataFrame
2. Bivariate Analysis with Scatter Plots
3. Univariate Analysis with Histograms
4. Presenting the Analysis based on various Majors
